# Elixir resources

This document contains the links/resources I used to write all the code in this repo:

- [Elixir in 100 Seconds] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7t7zca8SyM) - very short youtube video that shows the basic commands for running, file type for saving and syntax;
    - Does not answer what is an atom, just mentions it's existence

- [Elixir HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/) - really helpful reference if you know what you are looking for - wish JS had something similar...

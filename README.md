# Learning elixir

This is the code I wrote when I was learning elixir as part of the ElixirQuest with [sorentwo](https://sorentwo.com)

The file structure of the repo is:

- `./resources.md` - The places I look to find info on Elixir!
- `./` - The code exercises I completed to learn the basic syntax of Elixir
